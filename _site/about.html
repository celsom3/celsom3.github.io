## About

I have been a digital activist since 2009 when I became active in the undocumented youth movement for immigrant rights. Ever since then, I believe that solid digital tools can help us make the change we want.

Throughout my 6 years of digital organizing, I have learned invaluable skills in Project Management, Wordpress Theming, PHP, Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I have worked with various tools and frameworks such as Wordpress, NationBuilder, Salsa Labs, NGP VAN, Mailchimp, Bootstrap, Jquery, and Angular.js
