<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>My name is <strong itemprop="name">Celso Mireles</strong>, I have seen <strong>{{ myage }} summers</strong>. I was born on the US/Mexico border city <em>Ciudad Juarez</em>, Mexico. I now live in Phoenix, AZ.</p>

  <p>Even as a Business Management major at the W.P. Carey School of Businesss at Arizona State University, I had a passion for technology and software. I moonlighted through one of the 'Learn C++ in 24 hours' books passed down to me from an electrical engineer friend.</p>

  <p>After graduating, I fed my passion for computer science by taking an online Java programming intro course.</p>

	<p>Then the whole Dream Act movement started taking place and I joined the ranks of countless other social justice warriors fighting the good fight: stopping deportations, demanding administrative relief of President Obama, etc.</p>

  <p>After that I went back to consulting and now offer digital strategy and web development services.</p>
