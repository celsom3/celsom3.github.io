      <p>So we went up to Flagstaff for some time in the snow this weekend. The nephew had wanted to see some snow for a while now and I was more than happy to test out my cool little pocket stove.</p>
      <p>I had gotten it at a military surplus store. The plan was to take it with me on motorcycle rides or when hiking. Not a lot of motorcycle rides and haven&#39;t been hiking for almost a year now, so on to rationalize this purchase with one more and
        at least get a blog post out of it.</p>
      <p>I was also excited because I wanted to &#39;field test&#39; my small cast iron skillet. For those that don&#39;t know, I love cooking with cast iron. Just the fact that I&#39;m not cooking with that cancer-causing teflon makes me feel better. But
        also, cast iron is bad ass. I like the fact that I can cook on it on pretty much any heat source:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Electric stove</li>
        <li>Gas Stove</li>
        <li>In the oven</li>
        <li>On a campfire</li>
        <li>On top of a wood stove</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I&#39;ve always wanted to consider myself an outdoorsman. A rugged outfitter in commune with the land that surrounds him. I haven&#39;t had much luck with that because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The requires I actually spent time out in the wild</li>
        <li>I live in a city. Getting out into nature is when it&#39;s suburban sprawl as far as the eye can see.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I know; excuses. So I suppose I&#39;ll just boil it down to the &#39;Big City Blues&#39;. I&#39;ve had this for a while. My few close friends would know that we have an exit plan of sorts. The goal is to move out of the city (it is such an unsustainable
        way of life, both economically and environmentally). But the blues came because at the end of the day, I&#39;m was headed back to Phoenix.</p>
      <p>What a tease.</p>
      <p>I really did enjoy cooking those hot dogs out in the snow. My wife made sandwiches. The nephews went sledding down the hills. We spent an hour getting our truck out of the snow.</p>
      <p>What did it all mean to me? I guess it meant that there is still hope to achieve that dream. The dream of living a simple life, in sync with nature. Growing our own food. Having a small carbon footprint. Not being the trash generating, consumers
        we currently are.</p>
      <p>You can&#39;t do that in a city. You have to go out to the small towns; out there where you can grow your own food, have some chickens or a goat. Walk five minutes and be surrounded by trees. Be away from hustle of what society deems life.</p>
      <p>Because maybe I don&#39;t believe that everybody needs a job. Because I don&#39;t believe that we should pay the bills. Because maybe I don&#39;t believe that bills are necessary. Because maybe I don&#39;t need that Netflix account, or that Spotify
        account. Because maybe I don&#39;t need electricity (I can set up and maintain my own solar power). Because maybe I don&#39;t need water service (because then I will be forced to use water wisely). Because maybe I don&#39;t need to be a productive
        member of society, when that society killing our planet.</p>
      <p>Maybe. I did recently drive a gas-guzzling SUV to Northern Arizona just to see the snow and cook hot dogs.</p>
