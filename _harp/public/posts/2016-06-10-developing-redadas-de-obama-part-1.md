## The Idea

The idea came about in a conversation with the Cosecha folks in Boston. We were brainstorming ideas to generate attention. We needed a way to eyes on Cosecha and build a list.

Sometime after, the idea came to me, "This is an opportunity to brige your two passions: social justice and development". And so I thought that it would be cool to build a tool that:

1. Is useful to the immigrant community
2. Can build a list for Cosecha
3. Is provocative enough that it can start shifting mindsets
4. Is in Spanish first, because it is meant to be used by undocumented Latinx immigrants

So the idea of developing a crowdsource immigration raid web app was born. To be fair, this idea is [nothing new](https://migramap.latinorebels.com/), but what really made me excited was the idea of naming it "Redadas de Obama".

I would think, "Imagine if this thing gained so much traction, that there were news reports on it? Merely saying the name 'Redadas de Obama' would have to start changing the narrative." (I'm also not hung up on the name. This project could just as easily change to Redadas De Hillary, or Redadas Democratas).

## The Technology

So once I got the idea, shared it with the team, and saw there was excitement, I went to work. My first thought was, "How am I going to build this thing?"

[Meteor.js](http://meteor.com) was the first thing that came to mind. This was mainly because I really enjoy the framework, and I have a [couple](http://undocumoney.com) of Meteor [projects](https://github.com/Cosecha/cosecha-app) under my belt.

But I also wanted to explore the latest technology. The new kid on the block. Sure, why not: let's use [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the view layer for the meteor app.

What could go wrong?

## Starting the Project

Like a good boy, and in line with the [Scrum development workflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), I set out to create a list of MVP user stories:

1. User Authentication
2. View map of raids
3. Register a raid
4. Get alerts of nearby raids
5. Display a feed of social media content

[I went ahead and created issues out of these in the repository.](https://github.com/Cosecha/redadas-de-obama/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22user+stories%22+)

This was good and all, but I wanted to pretend like this was a big development team that called for a more complicated workflow.

So I installed the [ZenHub plugin](w.zenhub.com) to extend the GitHub interface to a more sophisticated workflow. Kanban boards, burndown charts, you name it.

This might have been overkill for an open source project of just one contributor, but my justification was that I was gaining valuable development workflow experience. And I have.
