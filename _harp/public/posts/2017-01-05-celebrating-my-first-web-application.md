Starting in November of 2014, I dove into the world of freelancing. This was after spending most of that year moonlighting online web development courses. I started developing websites using WordPress, providing digital consulting services, making a static site using Angular here and there, and finding an excuse to use Meteor.js in my immigrant rights movement pro-bono work.

In the summer of 2016, I was at a bit of a crossroads. I had been freelancing for about 2 years. My career transition from digital marketer for non-profit organizations to web developer was halfway complete; I had more skills (ie. git, WordPress, NPM, build tools, VIM) but had yet to join a team. And while I enjoyed the freedom of being a freelancer, I saw myself itching to join a team and be part of a larger project.

Then I came across React.js. Another thing to learn, but everything made sense. I felt stuck. It was as if I couldn't go beyond the simplified tutorial examples. The problem: I didn't really know Node.js.

All it took was my mentor providing a viable option:

> "If you want to learn Node, then you need to develop a Node application. If you want to learn React, then you need to use React."

So I started learning Node and React through an open source passion project. (https://github.com/Cosecha/redadalertas)

The final sign from the universe was when Ray Ybarra, a Phoenix-based immigration attorney, reached out to me. He said he wanted to create a tool where users could answer simple questions and know what type of relief they may qualify for.

It was the final ingredient, if you will. I said to myself, "Well, Node.js and React.js would be great tool to build this with." And so the project started.

I must admit, I was a little nervous, this being my first paid web application and all. I accepted that I didn't know everything I needed to know to build the application. However, I did know what I needed to learn. I took on the project and dove right in.

My mentor was right. You learn so much more when you are faced with a real problem to solve, with real deadlines (not to mention, my reputation) on the line. Three and half months later, I was able to launch the web application!

I learned so much with this project. From a technical perspective, I found that developing with React.js and Redux was enjoyable. One-way data flow makes perfect sense, and following the 'react way' prevented me from ending up with a bunch of 'spaghetti code' to deliver. I also gained Node experience while building the API to be consumed by the web app.

It's kind of crazy that I, a learning web developer, could build a web application with user accounts, a clean UI, and pretty decent load times, in about 4 months. Of course, I can't take all the credit. I definitely relied heavily from tools like Auth0, and open-source projects like Material-UI and React-Toolbox. And of course, React.js, Redux, Node.js, NPM.

With this project delivered and deployed, I'm at a new crossroads in my career. I now feel more confident to join to team and be part of something bigger. The transition is almost complete.
