Today was pretty epic for me. Not gonna lie.

At the risk of sounding like a total noob, I will announce that today was the first time I contributed to an open source project.

Let me start from the _beginning_.

So I started to work on a [plugin](https://github.com/PochoLabs/WordPress-PochoMaps) based off a project I did for a client. Simple enough. I was following a tutorial on how to deploy WordPress plugins and be able to update them from a GitHub repository.

_Very handy stuff._

Well, the code wasn't working for me. I submitted an issue ticket, but then I said:

> I should try and find out what is wrong myself and see I can share what I learn with the author.

Four hours later, I found what was wrong and submitted a pull request.
