I must admit, I would internally roll my eyes when friends bash on the now famous _Hamburger Menu_.

I'd just nod and smile, and think

>but it's such a genius design. It solves the problem of precious real estate on mobile screens.

I guess those friends never really explained _why_ the Hamburger Menu was so annoying. But I recently [read a piece](http://deep.design/the-hamburger-menu/) by [James Archer](http://www.jamesarcher.me/) that opened my eyes as to the utilitarian reason for not using this design pattern as the primary navigation for a site or app.

The basic idea is that by using the Hamburger Menu, you are essentially hiding content from the user, and no matter how much you want them to, users will **NOT** click on it to find what they are looking for.

It was a good read, for sure, and now I'm thinking:

>How can implement this in my own work... right now?

Luckily, I have a client whose website I'm currently redesigning, and she may benefit from this. I will brainstorm on how to implement this new nugget of wisdom immediately.

Speaking of immediately, I am adding it to my to-do list right now to take out the hamburger icon out from this website. We'll see how that goes, seeing as:

>The cobbler's children are always the worst-shod.

That is actually a good topic for another post...
